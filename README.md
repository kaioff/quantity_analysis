# Quantity Analysis
The following analysis was conducted on jupyter notebook using python.

**Analysis Objective**
The following is an explanation of my work on the activity called "Quantity Analysis" where I compare Bitstamp and Coinbase and try to identify on which period of the day (early, middle, late) you can breakeven or make a profit. 


On the first image, you can see a graphic for the closed Bitstamp coin prices.
